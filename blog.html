Later on this Study Center was converted in regular post graduate Department and named as "University Department of Computer Applications".

After inspecting the infrastructure of the Department, the AICTE, accorded its first approval in 2004 vide its Letter No. PG/MCA/ BIH/2004 dated 11/05/2004 to conduct the course with an Intake of sixty students.</p>
        <br>
        
        <p> Hon'ble Chancellor of the Universities of Bihar has been pleased to approve the draft ordinance for MCA Course, in exercise of the power vested in him under section 38/(4) of the Bihar State University Act, 1976 as amended upto date. This has been communicated by Governor's Secretariat, Bihar vide its letter no TMBU -16/2003-941 /GS (I) dated 6/03/ 2006.</p>
        <br>
