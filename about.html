                <h1>UDCA is a constituent unit of T.M.Bhagalpur University, Bhagalpur</h1>
                <p>University Department of Computer Application ( UDCA ) is a constituent unit of Tilka Manghi Bhagalpur University, Bhagalpur, Bihar. It is formally known as COMPUTER CENTRE. This University Department of Computer Applications offers Master of Computer Application ( MCA ) course . UDCA is Recognised By Govt. of Bihar and Approved By AICTE, New Delhi.


                    After an initial survey of the demands for studies in the field of Information Technology, the University, in early 2002, decided to start MCA Course in the Computer Centre. Consequently, a three years (i.e., 6 Semester) regular Course of Master of Computer Application (MCA) was started during 2002 with the infrastructure of the Computer Centre and named as "MCA Study Centre". Later on this Study Center was converted in regular post graduate Department and named as "University Department of Computer Applications". Presently this Department is conducting the MCA Course.
                    
                    After getting no objection certificate from the Department of Science and Technology, Government of Bihar, the University approached the All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE), New Delhi for approval of the course. After inspecting the infrastructure of the Department, the AICTE, accorded its first approval in 2004 vide its Letter No. PG/MCA/ BIH/2004 dated 11/05/2004 to conduct the course with an Intake of sixty students.
                    
                    The Hon'ble Chancellor of the Universities of Bihar has been pleased to approve the draft ordinance for MCA Course, in exercise of the power vested in him under section 38/(4) of the Bihar State University Act, 1976 as amended upto date. This has been communicated by Governor's Secretariat, Bihar vide its letter no TMBU -16/2003-941 /GS (I) dated 6/03/ 2006.
                    
                    AICTE has been changed MCA program from 03 years to 02 years. Hence The MCA Course shall be of 02 years duration from 2020-21. (Vide Letter no. AICTE/ABMCA/2020-21 dated 03.07.2020.)</p>
